# Fluted Glass Design Update

## Overview
Enhanced the sign-in page with a sophisticated fluted glass design that creates a ribbed, textured glass effect with a gradient background showing through.

## Design Elements

### 1. **Fluted Glass Pattern**
```css
backgroundImage: `repeating-linear-gradient(
  90deg,
  rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0px,    /* Bright ridge */
  rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.03) 2px,   /* Soft fade */
  transparent 2px,                  /* Valley */
  transparent 4px,                  /* Valley */
  rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.04) 4px,   /* Soft rise */
  rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 6px,    /* Ridge */
  rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05) 8px,   /* Fade */
  transparent 8px,                  /* Valley */
  transparent 10px                  /* Valley */
)`
```
- Creates vertical ridges and valleys
- 10px repeat pattern for fine texture
- Variable opacity for depth perception

### 2. **Layered Background**
1. **Base Layer**: Gradient from primary to secondary colors
   - `from-primary/20 via-secondary/10 to-primary/20`
   - Creates rich color depth

2. **Animated Orbs**: Large blurred circles
   - Primary and secondary colored orbs
   - Pulse animation for life
   - Creates dynamic background movement

3. **Fluted Glass Overlay**: Two patterns
   - Primary pattern: Fine 10px ridges
   - Secondary pattern: Wider 20px ridges
   - Creates complex light refraction

4. **Shimmer Effect**: Animated light sweep
   - 8-second animation cycle
   - Subtle white gradient moving across
   - Enhances glass-like appearance

### 3. **Floating Elements**
- **Glass Shards**: Replaced orbs with rectangular glass pieces
  - Various sizes (24x36 to 36x52)
  - Rotated at different angles
  - Float animation for depth
  - Semi-transparent with backdrop blur

### 4. **Enhanced Card Design**
- **Background**: `bg-white/10 dark:bg-black/10`
  - More transparent to show fluted background
  - Different opacity for light/dark modes

- **Backdrop Blur**: Increased to `backdrop-blur-2xl`
  - Stronger blur for better readability
  - Creates frosted glass effect

- **Inner Glow**: Gradient overlay
  - `from-white/5 to-transparent`
  - Adds dimensional depth

### 5. **Visual Effects**

#### Shimmer Animation
```css
@keyframes shimmer {
  0% { background-position: -1000px 0; }
  100% { background-position: 1000px 0; }
}
```
- Creates moving light effect
- Simulates light reflecting off glass ridges

#### Float Animation (existing)
- Applied to glass shards
- Creates sense of depth and movement

## Technical Implementation

### CSS Techniques Used:
1. **Repeating Linear Gradients**: For fluted pattern
2. **Multiple Layers**: For complex visual depth
3. **Backdrop Filter**: For glass blur effects
4. **CSS Animations**: For movement and life
5. **Opacity Layers**: For subtle depth perception

### Performance Considerations:
- Backdrop filters are GPU accelerated
- Animations use transform for efficiency
- Gradients are optimized for rendering

## Color Harmony
- Maintains school brand colors (green & orange)
- Uses transparent whites for glass effects
- Gradient background unifies the color scheme

## Accessibility
- High contrast maintained for text
- Card background ensures readability
- Focus states preserved

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with backdrop-filter support
- Graceful degradation without breaking functionality
- Tested across major browsers

The fluted glass design creates a premium, sophisticated appearance while maintaining the school's branding and ensuring excellent usability. The ribbed texture adds visual interest and depth to the sign-in experience.
