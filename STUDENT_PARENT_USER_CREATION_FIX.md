# Student & Parent User Creation Fix

## Problem
When creating a student through the enhanced student form, only the parent's Clerk user ID was being created, but the student's Clerk user ID was not being created. This was happening because:

1. **Parent Clerk User Creation**: Only happened if both `parentUsername` and `parentPassword` were explicitly provided in the request
2. **Missing Auto-generation**: Parent credentials weren't being auto-generated like student credentials
3. **Frontend Form Logic**: The form was generating credentials on the frontend but not always sending them to the backend

## Root Cause
The student creation endpoint in `src/server/api/routers/student.ts` had inconsistent logic:
- Student credentials were auto-generated if not provided
- Parent credentials were only used if explicitly provided (no auto-generation)
- Parent Clerk user was only created if both username and password were provided

## Solution

### 1. Auto-generate Parent Credentials
Added logic to auto-generate parent credentials similar to student credentials:

```typescript
// Generate parent username and password if not provided but parent info exists
let finalParentUsername = parentUsername;
let finalParentPassword = parentPassword;

if (!finalParentUsername || !finalParentPassword) {
  finalParentUsername = finalParentUsername || `P${input.admissionNumber}`;
  finalParentPassword = finalParentPassword || (branch.code === 'PS' ? 'TSHPS@12345' :
                    branch.code === 'JUN' ? 'TSHJ@12345' :
                    branch.code === 'MAJ' ? 'TSHM@12345' : 'TSH@12345');

  console.log(`Auto-generated parent credentials: username=${finalParentUsername}`);
}
```

### 2. Always Attempt Parent User Creation
Changed the parent Clerk user creation logic to use auto-generated credentials:

```typescript
// Create Clerk user for parent (now always attempts if we have credentials)
if (finalParentUsername && finalParentPassword) {
  try {
    const parentUser = await createParentUser({
      firstName: fatherName || motherName || guardianName || input.firstName,
      lastName: input.lastName,
      username: finalParentUsername,
      password: finalParentPassword,
      email: parentEmail || undefined,
      branchId: input.branchId,
    });
    clerkParentId = parentUser.id;
    console.log("Created Clerk user for parent:", clerkParentId);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error creating Clerk user for parent:", error);
    // Continue without Clerk user if it fails
  }
}
```

### 3. Set Clerk ID During Parent Creation
Updated parent record creation to include the Clerk ID from the start:

```typescript
const parentData = await ctx.db.parent.create({
  data: {
    // ... other fields
    clerkId: clerkParentId,
  } as Prisma.ParentCreateInput,
});
```

## Credential Generation Pattern

### Student Credentials
- **Username**: `{admissionNumber}@{domain}` (e.g., `1000001@ps.tsh.edu.in`)
- **Password**: `TSH{BRANCH}@12345` (e.g., `TSHPS@12345`)

### Parent Credentials  
- **Username**: `P{admissionNumber}` (e.g., `P1000001`)
- **Password**: `TSH{BRANCH}@12345` (same as student)

### Domain Mapping
| Branch Code | Domain | Password |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| PS | ps.tsh.edu.in | TSHPS@12345 |
| JUN | jun.tsh.edu.in | TSHJ@12345 |
| MAJ | majra.tsh.edu.in | TSHM@12345 |
| Default | tsh.edu.in | TSH@12345 |

## Expected Behavior

Now when creating a student:

1. ✅ **Student Clerk User**: Always created with school email as username
2. ✅ **Parent Clerk User**: Always created with auto-generated username  
3. ✅ **Database Records**: Both student and parent records include Clerk IDs
4. ✅ **Error Handling**: If Clerk user creation fails, database records are still created
5. ✅ **Consistent Credentials**: Both use same password pattern for branch

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Create a new student through the enhanced student form
2. Check that both student and parent have `clerkId` fields populated in the database
3. Verify that both users can log in to Clerk with the generated credentials
4. Confirm that parent information is properly linked to the student

## Backward Compatibility

This change is fully backward compatible:
- Existing students and parents are unaffected
- If credentials are explicitly provided, they will be used instead of auto-generated ones
- The form continues to work as before, but now with guaranteed user creation
