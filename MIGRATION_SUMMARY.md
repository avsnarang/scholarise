## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Users can't log in | Check they're using `TempPass123!` |
| Missing roles | Run `npm run migrate:update-rbac` |
| Supabase errors | Check environment variables |
| Email delivery issues | Configure Supabase SMTP settings |

### Migration Reports
All scripts generate detailed reports in `migration-reports/`:
- Migration statistics
- Error analysis  
- Success rates by user type
- Troubleshooting recommendations

### Emergency Rollback
If needed (not recommended after users start using new system):
1. Restore database from backup
2. Revert environment variables to Clerk
3. Redeploy with Clerk authentication

## Environment Requirements

Ensure these are set before migration:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key  
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```
